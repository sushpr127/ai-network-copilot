# AI Networking Copilot

An experimental AI system that models a professional knowledge graph and computes weighted multi-hop trust propagation to surface optimal introduction paths.

## Objective

To explore:
- Graph-based relationship modeling
- Weighted edge scoring
- Multi-hop path ranking
- Trust propagation
- AI-based explanation layers (planned)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Custom graph traversal logic
- Planned: Embeddings + LLM reasoning

## Current Phase

Phase 1: Database schema design  
Phase 2: Synthetic graph generation  
Phase 3: Path scoring engine  
Phase 4: AI explanation layer  

🚧 Work in Progress
